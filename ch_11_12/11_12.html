        <p id="cncinfo">The <strong>Cloud Native Computing</strong> program prepares the students to program in open
            source
            technologies like, <strong><em>Linux, Docker, Kubernetes, JavaScript, Node.js, React and React
                    Native</em></strong>
            while introducing the students to development of Microservices and software development
            techniques on cloud platforms like AWS.

        <p id="aiinfo">The <strong>artificial intelligence</strong> program of PIAIC takes the student through the
            foundation of the AI
            technology, via teaching programming in open source languages like <strong><em>Python, Numpy, Pandas,
                    Tensorflow 2.0 and Flask,</em></strong> and teaching deploying practical AI solutions and use cases,
            and
